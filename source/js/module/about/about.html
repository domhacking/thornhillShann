            <p class="text">There's an old saying that failing to prepare is preparing to fail, and it's a sentiment that's at the heart of Thornhill Shann. Planning is, to our minds, the most important part of the job.</p>

            <p class="text">Too many contractors either begin without a formal timescale projection, or conversely employ so many layers of supervision that reaching any decision takes far too long, or that decision may be made by a person so far removed that they have no hands-on knowledge of the project itself.</p>

            <p class="text">We use only the best people, and use them to create a realistic and detailed timetable of works, tailored to our clients' requirements. Our craftsmen are employed directly by Thornhill Shann and our site managers are second-to-none, meaning that our plans will be created and executed by one team, who know your build inside out and are committed to creating a fantastic end result on time and on budget, from the outset.</p>

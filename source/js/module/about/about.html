            <p class="text">The three most important rules for a successful building contract are Planning, Planning and Planning. Too many builders embark on a building contract with no formal plan or timetable and consequently before too long, the contract starts to drift into a state of semi- disorganised chaos</p>

            <p class="text">Conversely, some contractors have so many layers of supervision that all too often by the time the decision is made it is either too late or it has been made by som-one so far up the chain of command with no detailed knowledge of the contract that the wrong decision is made.</p>

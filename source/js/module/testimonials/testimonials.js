They did an excellent, high quality finish to all the work and what we really liked was how they did it quickly, quietly and with minimum fuss and made changes without hassle when agreed with Tom. They came back and did that last 10% of snagging at the end of the work without needing to be chased up. We were very happy with the outcome and will use them again.",
